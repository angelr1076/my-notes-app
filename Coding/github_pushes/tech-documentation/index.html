                <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.</p>

                <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>

                <li>In December 1995, soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers, Netscape introduced an implementation of the language for server-side scripting with Netscape Enterprise Server.</li>

                <li>Since 1996, the IIS web-server has supported Microsoft's implementation of server-side Javascript -- JScript—in ASP and .NET pages.</li>

            <header>What you should already know</header>
            <p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.</p>
            <p>Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.</p>

            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

            <code>if (!foundMatch) {
                    wrongSound.play();
                    guessesLeft--;
                    guesses.innerHTML = `You have ${guessesLeft} guesses left`;
                    listOfGuesses.push(letter);
                    let convertToString = listOfGuesses.toString();
                    displayChoices.innerHTML = `Letters you guessed: ${convertToString}`;
        
                }</code>

        <section id="Hello_world" class="main-section">
            <header>Hello world</header>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
                <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
                alert("Hello " + yourName);
                }
                greetMe("World");</code>

        <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
            <code><p>if (score === 10) {
                    gameWon.play();
                    hint.innerHTML = "Congratulations, you are the Word Spin master!!!";
                    hint.style.color = "#ffa500";
                    setTimeout(() => {
                        window.location.replace("index.html");
                    }, 3000);

        <section id="Declaring_variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables. By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
            <code><p>const buttonPress = e => {</p></code>
            <code><p>letterClicked = e.target.textContent;</p></code>
            <code><p>matchWord(letterClicked);</p></code>
            <code><p>}</p></code>
        </section>
        <section id="Variable_scope" class="main-section">
            <header>Variable scope</header>
            <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
            <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
            <code>if (true) {
                    var x = 5;
                  }
                  console.log(x);  // 5</code>
        </section>
        <section id="Global_variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Global variables</header>
            <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
            <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
